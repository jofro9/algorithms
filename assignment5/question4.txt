Part A

two-dimensional array called donations that is size D * L

TotalDifferentDonations(D, L)
	if D is zero
		then return one

	else if donations[D, L] exists
		return donations[D, L]

	different is 0
	j is L
	
	while j greater than 0
		increment different by TotalDifferentDonations(D, L)
		decrement j
	
	donations[D,j] is different

	return donation[D, different]

This solution should run in O(D * L) because it is only dependent upon traversal of the two-dimensional array `donations`, which is size D * L.
