You have made a fortune in Wall Street. The IRS is suspicious and you must launder the money.
You have D dollars and you are considering all the different ways you can divide this amount (in
integer values) to n different criminal groups. Each group can take up to ai dollars without
alerting the IRS. You also have D Â£ a1 + a2 + .. + an. Using bottom-up dynamic programing,
write pseudo-code to determine how many different ways you can divide the D dollars. What is
the running time of your solution?

two-dimensional array called fraud that is size D * N

TaxFraud(D, N)
	if D is zero
		then return one

	else if fraud[D, N] exists
		return fraud[D, N]

	j is N
	
	while j greater than 0
		count += TaxFraud(D, j)
		decrement j
	
	donations[D,j] is different

	return donation[D, j]
