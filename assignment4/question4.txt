Question 4:

One problem with hashing based on the first letter, is that regardless of the value of the rest of the letters in the word,
two words that start with the same letter will have the same hash value, so we will have collisions with no way of finding
the original word. Additionally, this hash doesn't differentiate between length of work, so for example, 'and' and 'alphabet'
will have the same hash value.
