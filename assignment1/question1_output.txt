Question 1)

Part A:

You have created 100 light bulbs
All switches are off

After person 10, there are 49 lights on, and 51 lights off.
After person 40, there are 54 lights on, and 46 lights off.
After person 70, there are 36 lights on, and 64 lights off.
After person 100, there are 10 lights on, and 90 lights off.

Part B:

Because the switches are starting in an "off" position, only the switches that are hit an
odd number of times will be left on, or values that have an odd number of factors. Most all
values have an even number of factors, except for the perfect squares. These are 1, 4, 9,
16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. Hence why 10 swithces are left on after the 100th person
passes through. Mathematically, this is the finite series from 1 to 10 of n^2.
