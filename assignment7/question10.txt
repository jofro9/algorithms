Question 10.

In class, we saw how we could rewrite the FIB procedure with multithreading:

P-FIB( n )
	if n â‰¤ 1
		return n
	else x = spawn P-FIB(n - 1)
		y = P-FIB(n - 2)
		sync
		return x + y

You get the idea of improving the algorithm by changing line y = P-FIB(n - 2) to y = spawn P-FIB(n - 2). Will this idea improve the algorithm? Explain your answer.

I believe that because the two recursive calls (lines 4 and 5) of P-FIB() are independent of eachother, running line 5 in parallel will not affect the solution itself. And then we would be running both Fibonacci recurrence relations in parallel for a reduction in time complexity.
