Question 11.

Given that x and y > 0 and that x is a divisor of y. Show that for any number n, we have (n mod y) mod x = n mod x.

Proof.

	Since (x, y) > 0 and x is a divisor of y,	(given)
	Let y = C * x, where c is a constant, contained in R,
	Let n % y = z,
	Therefore, n = z + D * y, where d is a constant, contained in R,

	n % x   = (z + D * y) % x
		= (z + D * (C * x)) % x
		= (z + (C * D * X)) % x
		= z % x			{(C * D * X) % x = 0}
		= (n % y) % x

	Q. E. D.
