Question 7. (10 points)

Given the network below, we can formulate the maximum flow problem as a linear program.
The general formulation given in the book (Section 29.2) is reproduced below:

(a) Reduce the number of constraints in the general formation above by indexing of edges instead of vertices.
(b) Write the linear program to solve the maximum flow program of the network below.
(c) Convert the linear program in standard form
(d) Convert the linear program in slack form
(e) Solve for the first two iterations of the linear program using the simplex algorithm. Show your work.
