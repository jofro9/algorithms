Question 6

Given point p0 = (x0,y0). The polar angle of point p1=(x0+1,y0+1) with respect to p0 is 45
degrees. The polar angle of point p2=(x0+1,y0-1) with respect to p0 is 315 degrees. How can
you sort n points (p1, p2, p3, p4, ..,, pn) with respect to p0 using only cross products in
O(nlogn)?

We can divide and conquer to sort this list. Lets use mergesort which is time O(nlogn).

We need a function that takes two points as an argument;
	1. check if the y component of the first point is greater than zero and the y component of the second point is less than zero, and returns true if so.
	2. check if the y component of the first point is less than zero and the y component of the second point is greater than zero, and returns false is so.

Now check if the x component of point 1 times the y compnenet of point two minus the x compenent of point two times the y component of point 1 is negative.
Else return true.
