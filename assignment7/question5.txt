Question 5. (4 points)

For the statements below, say whether they are True or False and explain your answer.

(a) Your colleague wants to prove that a given problem is NP-complete. He has reduced
the problem to 3-CNF satisfiability, which shows that the problem is NP-complete.



(b) If there is a polynomial-time algorithm for 3-CNF satisfiability, then every problem in NP
has a polynomial-time algorithm, and if any problem in NP has a polynomial-time
algorithm, then 3-CNF has a polynomial-time algorithm.
