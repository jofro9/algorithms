Question 5. (4 points)

For the statements below, say whether they are True or False and explain your answer.

(a) Your colleague wants to prove that a given problem is NP-complete. He has reduced the problem to 3-CNF satisfiability, which shows that the problem is NP-complete.

True. 3-cnf-sat is a subeset of cnf expressions, and cnf are NP-complete. Therefore, by association, 3-cnf-sat is NP-complete. 

(b) If there is a polynomial-time algorithm for 3-CNF satisfiability, then every problem in NP has a polynomial-time algorithm, and if any problem in NP has a polynomial-time algorithm, then 3-CNF has a polynomial-time algorithm.

False. There is no existing proof for a polynomial time algorithm for an NP-complete problem. This problem is both solved and reduced to 3cnf-sat in polynomial time.
