Question 6. (5 points)

Run Dijsktra’s algorithm on Graph 3 starting from vertex a. Show the d and 𝜋 values at each
iteration.

Shortest path by Dijkstra

iteration | vertex | d | 𝜋
1	    a	     0	 NULL
2	    b	     4	 a
3	    c	     7   d
4	    d	     2   a
5	    e        5   b
6	    g	     12  b
7	    h	     15  i
8	    i        14  g

I wasn't 100% sure if you can traverse any direction on an edge in Dijkstra's algorithm, so this is potentially going the wrong direction down some edges.
