Question 2. (2 points)

Assume vertex v is a descendent of vertex u in a directed graph G and vertex u is not a
descendent of vertex v. After running dept-first search on G, is it true that v.f > u.f? Explain
your answer.

v.f cannot be greater than u.f

Directed graph implies connection in at least one direction, so while there may be an edge from u to v, there may not be an edge from v to u, and we know this because v is a descendent of u, and u is NOT a descendent of v. In a depth first search, we would check all of the neighbors of u first, which also means that we will finish searching descendents of u before v. Hence, time of v cannot be greater than time of u.
