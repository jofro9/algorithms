Assume you have n currencies C={c1, .., cn} and you have the exchange rates rij between all pair
of currencies i and j. All exchange rates are positive. Could you use Bellman-Ford to compute
the most profitable sequence of currency exchanges between all pairs of currencies (assuming
no negative weight cycles)? For example, the most profitable path to exchange currency c2 to
currency c7 could be to first convert to currency c1 and then to c7. In other words, the exchange
rates would be r21 × r17.

The goal is to maximize the products of the exchange rates between any two currencies.

Hint: Given variables x1 and x2, maximizing the product (x1 × x2) is equivalent to maximizing log
(x1 × x2).

Ligically speaking, it seems like an inefficient algorithm to maximize profit from exhcange rates, however it seems possible. We need to maximize the product of the r_i1, r_i2, ..., r_ik-1, r_ik, which mathematically is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the [-log(r_ij, r_ij+1)] from j = 1 to (k-1) (see hint). The reason we can do this, is because the Bellman-Ford algorithm alows for negative weights.
